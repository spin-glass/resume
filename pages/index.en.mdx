## Job Summary

For the past five years, I have worked mainly as a data scientist, considering and implementing appropriate on-the-spot approaches to various issues.

Currently, I am working for a consulting firm, where I am learning consulting skills such as problem organization and documentation.
I am currently working for a consulting firm, where I am learning consulting skills such as organizing issues and preparing documents, as well as learning how to improve business by linking data science to KPIs.

I have worked in a variety of fields and have found that the common problems are

- It takes a lot of time and effort to link data science knowledge to system development.
- The lack of reviews and other review activities makes the analytical tasks mundane to the data scientist, making it difficult to make improvements to the analysis.
  I myself have experienced difficulties in this regard.

I myself have experienced difficulties in this regard, so I would like to contribute by making use of my experience and skills.
I am learning about data analysis and MLOps on a daily basis, and I would like to work together with anyone who has similar ideas.
